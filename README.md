Using Spectral Analysis and Time Forecasting methods
This project aims to utilize data queried from the ERA5 Reanalysis Product to identify and analyze any long term trends that appear. The data captures 80 years of daily sea surface temperature, wave height, and wind speed data from seven major ocean basins: the Arctic, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans.
